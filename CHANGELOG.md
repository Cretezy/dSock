## Unreleased

- **Breaking**
  - Changed response format for creating claims
    - All claim data is now inside the `claim` key, and more data is present. Example:
    
      Before:
      ```json
      {
        "success": true,
        "id": "XXX",
        "expiration": 1588473164
      }
      ```
      
      After:
      ```json
      {
        "success": true,
        "claim": {
          "id": "XXX",
          "expiration": 1588473164,
          "user": "a",
          "session": "b"
        }
      }
      ```
